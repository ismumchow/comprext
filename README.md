#Text Similarity App
The Text Similarity App is a web application that allows users to compare the similarity between two pieces of text. It utilizes natural language processing techniques to calculate the similarity score and display the results to the user.

Installation
To install the Text Similarity App, you will need to have Python 3.x and pip installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run npm -i requirements.txt to install the necessary dependencies.
Run npm run dev to start the application.
Usage
Once you have started the application, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. You will see a simple web form with two text areas. Simply enter the two pieces of text that you would like to compare and click the "Compare" button.

The application will then calculate the similarity score and display the results to the user. The similarity score is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no similarity and 1 indicates identical text.

How it works
The Text Similarity App uses the cosine similarity measure to calculate the similarity score between the two pieces of text. The cosine similarity measure compares the angle between the two text vectors in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a word in the text.

Before the cosine similarity measure is applied, the text is preprocessed to remove stop words, punctuation, and other noise. The remaining words are then transformed into numerical vectors using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique, which gives more weight to words that are more important in the text.
